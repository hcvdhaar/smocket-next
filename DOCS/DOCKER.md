**Dev Workflow with Docker**

- Add a Dockerfile to the project which is a set of commands to package the project as a Docker Image
- With the Docker Image, Docker runs the image and creates a container with the application.
- Once I have an Docker Image, it can be pushed to a registy (like github for Docker Images) and pull from that registry into a PROD environment like in my case Render / DigitalOcean??
